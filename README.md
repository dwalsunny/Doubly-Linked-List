# Linked_Queue


PODLL (Plain Old Doubly Linked List)

How to build/use:
  1. You must include the class as: #include "Double_list.h"
  2. The class Double_list is a template class, so it must be delcared as: 
        Double_list<Type>* dl = new Double_list<Type>();
  3. The interface (members and methods) can be seen in the Double_list.h header file.
